# 2048

Simple implementation of the 2048 game in Python 3. The framework allows for AI agents to play the game if they implement the simple interface defined in `random_agent.py`. 

# Requirements
numpy

# Run
To run the program, run `view.py` as a normal python program. Pass the desired agent into the View constructor in the main function, or no agent if you wish to play manually.
